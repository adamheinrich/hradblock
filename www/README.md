Source code for website [hradblock.adamh.cz](https://hradblock.adamh.cz). I've
used some great open source projects which was the main reason to make its
source public.

## Usage

Just run

    make serve

and head to [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to see the site in action.

## Based on

 * [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) - the static site generator
 * [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) - butler for Jekyll. Great thing to start with!
